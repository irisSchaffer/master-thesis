Mobile phones, tablets and laptops have become our every day companions. We take them with us wherever we go, may it be the classroom or meetings, lately they have even made an appearance in courtrooms \cite{Farrell:TrialByTablet}. Especially during presentations, mobile device usage is still perceived as rude and can be a source of distraction \cite{Bohmer:SmartphoneUseRude, Bajko:ComparativePerceptionSmartphoneMeeting, Kuznekoff:ImpactPhoneStudentLearning} although other studies indicate that lecture-relevant phone use in classrooms can actually be beneficial \cite{Kuznekoff:MobilePhoneClassroomTwitter}.

Instead of banning modern technologies, incorporating mobile devices into presentation workflows has proven to foster collaboration and connection between attendees in meetings \cite{Bohmer:SmartphoneUseRude} and could possibly promote participation and help introverts overcome the hurdle of speaking out loud \cite{Bry:Backstage}. The growing computing power as well as the ubiquitousness of mobile phones, tablets and laptops make them suitable candidates for giving instant feedback to speakers as well as voting and sharing relevant multi-media content on-the-fly. Resulting presentations provide more flexibility, a better understanding of the listeners' opinion and the potential to close the gap between the presenter and the audience.

The idea of using electronic devices to foster group interaction in meetings is not new. Stefik et al. \cite{Stefik:BeyondTheChalkboard} already experimented with the use of personal computers in meeting rooms as early as 1987. Around the same time 
 Since then, digital whiteboards, telepresence systems, productive multi-user web applications and other computer-aided collaboration tools have become a common sight. The use of portable devices like clickers or mobile phones in presentations, however, has only been studied over the last 5 to 10 years.

\subsection{Classroom-related}
Most of this research has been conducted in the educational sector, where growing class-sizes have caused student participation to sink drastically \cite{Bry:Backstage}. The first ap\-proa\-ches in this field of student-response-systems (SRS) utilised so-called clickers -- remote-control-like devices, connected to a receiver station via radio frequency technology \cite{cuclickers:faq} which can be used for tasks like taking attendance and voting \cite{Chamillard:StudentResponseSystem}. Using these clicker systems has shown to ``yield a strong and positive relationship with student learning'' \cite{Chamillard:StudentResponseSystem}. However, the limitations of clickers -- the need for proprietary hardware and the limited interface consisting only of a few buttons -- lead researchers to experiment with personal mobile devices as input instead. In 2007 Lindquist et al. \cite{Lindquist:ExploringMobilePhonesActiveLearning} presented a system integrated with the University of Washington's Classroom Presenter software, which lets students submit answers to assignments and in-class quizzes via SMS and MMS or using their laptops. Although the mobile phone users struggled with the input of longer messages, they perceived the ubiquity and concenience of using a light-weight personal device as an advantage. Most students, however, were worried about the costs of using SMS or MMS as a requirement in class -- a concern modern devices with internet access and cheap data plans dispel. The first of these web-based approaches were explored around the same time. Esponda \cite{Esponda:ElectronicVotingOnTheFly} for example describes a system in which iPods and other devices with access to wifi can be used to answer questions during class. What is interesting about her approach is not only the technology used, but also that questions do not have to be prepared in advance, but can also be created on-the-fly, using a pen-based tablet, resulting in more lively and spontaneous student-teacher-interaction.

More recent publications make use of modern web browsers' possibilities to enhance lectures and the interactivity of presentations. The tool \emph{ASQ} \cite{Triglianos:InteractiveWebPresentationsImpress} for example lets lecturers create HTML5 presentations with \emph{impress.js}\footnote{\url{http://impress.github.io/impress.js}} which are then distributed to listeners via a link. Students follow the presentations on their mobile devices, and can submit questions connected to the current slide to the speaker. Quizzes (both open questions and multiple-choice) can be embedded in the slides by the teacher. These quizzes can either be graded automatically (for coding assignments and multiple-choice questions), corrected by teaching assistants or by the students in self or peer-assessment. While this project has put a lot of effort into the server-side and administration of slidesets, the present approach concentrates more on the client-side and does not provide management tools. However, as noted by Esponda \cite{Esponda:ElectronicVotingOnTheFly}, being familiar with the listeners' understanding of a subject is important for creating the polls, which is why we also added the possibility of creating votings spontaniously.
Another interesting approach is presented by Cheng et al. \cite{Cheng:TreebasedOnlinePresentations}, who propose a system which generates HTML presentations from \emph{Microsoft PowerPoint} slides and lets viewers add their own content (either additional material or questions) as vertical sub-slides to them. This way a tree-like structure is created in which teachers and students collaborate in interactive presentations. This architecture also inspired the sub-slide based presentation space deployed in the present work.

Another popular application, with richer audience-spea\-ker-in\-ter\-ac\-tion and an emphasis on listener-listener-interaction is \emph{Backstage}\footnote{\url{http://backstage.pms.ifi.lmu.de/}}. As digital backchannels like Twitter can foster the sense of community within the audience, but are usually hard to follow for presenters, Bry et al.\cite{Bry:Backstage} developed a backchannel specifically for large classrooms. Students can post messages publicly and send private messages to their colleagues. These public posts can be up or down-voted, as well as marked as unrelated. Together with an ageing-algorithm, this community feedback is used to estimate a post's relevance. Important feedback is then presented to the lecturer, to allow him or her to get a better sense for the audiences' opinion and understanding. Additionally, small quizzes and polls serve as performance feedback to the teacher and students. Though one of the most mature systems studied for this thesis, having been developed specifically for classrooms, the use of the software in other scenarios is not ideal. Moreover, most of the features concentrate on listener-listener-interaction, while the present thesis focuses on mechanisms strengthening the speaker-audience-interaction.

\subsection{Meeting-environments and general approaches}

In contrast to classroom-related software, meeting-en\-vi\-ron\-ments usually have an significantly lower amount of participants, as well as a smaller gap between the speaker and the audience. Another difference lies in the polling, surveying and quizzing functionality which most of the presented projects offer: while these usually have one correct answer in educational settings, to grade students \cite{Lindquist:ExploringMobilePhonesActiveLearning, Triglianos:InteractiveWebPresentationsImpress, Bry:Backstage}, the goal in other environments is to make decisions and collect ideas, without judgment.
One publication which concentrates on these polls and their real-time evaluation and rendering is \cite{Inoue:RealTimeQuestionnaire}: Inoue et al. present a system which distributes \emph{Microsoft PowerPoint} presentations using modern web-technologies while making it possible to alter and update the slides in presentation mode. This way questionnaires can be answered and their results displayed in real-time. Additionally, members of the audience can add annotations (both handwritten and digital) to slides. Although this approach seems very promising, pictures, videos and other types of media are ignored entirely. Moreover the interface seems too complicated to be displayed on small devices and is therefore only usable on laptops and maybe tablets. Systems designed for mobile device use are proposed in several studies conducted by Microsoft Research \cite{Bohmer:SmartphoneUseRude,Teevan:MobileFeedbackDuringPresentation,Chattopadhyay:OfficeSocialRemoteControl}: In \cite{Bohmer:SmartphoneUseRude}, as well as examining the perception of smartphone use in meetings, the mobile application \emph{Meetster} is presented. The study finds that although people primarily use their phones for meeting or work-related tasks, they tend to think their colleagues use theirs for private purposes. Unlike the present thesis, in which mobile devices should be used in the context of presentations, \emph{Meetster} was developed to help getting to know other meeting attendees in a playful way. This changed the perception of using one's smartphone during the meeting and was described as ``fostering social interactions''.

\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{feedback-meetings-ms-research}\caption{\emph{Crowd Feedback} \cite{Teevan:MobileFeedbackDuringPresentation} used during a presentation. The bar next to the slides shows one dot per participant in the meeting. The feedback dots fade out over time.}\label{fig:related-work-crowd-feedback}
\end{figure}

\emph{Crowd Feedback} \cite{Teevan:MobileFeedbackDuringPresentation}, on the other side, is a system for displaying continuous, real-time feedback to the speaker in presentations. A responsive web application with a like and dislike button controls the feedback-system. The participants' reactions are shown with a red (dislike) or green (like) dot for each attendee in a sidebar next to the presentation slides (see figure \ref{fig:related-work-crowd-feedback}). An evaluation of the system showed that the participants felt more engaged with the presentation and connected to other listeners. Many users stated only having the possibility to like or dislike did not reflect enough options and that a button related to the speech pace might have helped. It was also noted that the sidebar was perceived as disturbing and made it harder to pay close attention to the presentation. This study and its conclusions have inspired the implementation of an instant feedback mechanism for listeners in the present work, however, instead of only having the binary like and dislike, the reactions are based on emojis, allowing for more insightful feedback.

The third study conducted by Microsoft Research concerns itself with the navigation through slides: \emph{Office Social} \cite{Chattopadhyay:OfficeSocialRemoteControl}, a PowerPoint plugin with companion smartphone app, allows presenters and listeners to navigate through PowerPoint slides using their mobile phones. Members of the audience can either browse the slides privately, or take over the control of the presented slides, allowing them to effictively steer the presentation or discussion. As in the present approach, Chattopadhyay et al.'s software allows members of the audience to review the slides privately, making it possible for latecomers to catch up and to generally estimate the length and direction of the talk. However, as their interface focuses on the navigation between slides, the preview of the slides is fairly small. Our approach tries to focus on the content of the slide and instead of offering big buttons to navigate around, makes use of intuitive swipe gestures. Another disadvantage is the overhead of having to download a smartphone application before the start of a presentation, as well as the limitation of the application only being available for Windows Phones.

\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{office-social}\caption{\emph{Office Social} \cite{Chattopadhyay:OfficeSocialRemoteControl}'s smartphone app interface. A preview of the slide is shown on top, followed by big buttons for navigating between slides.}\label{fig:related-work-crowd-feedback}
