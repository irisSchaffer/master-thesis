\section{Introduction}
Mobile phones, tablets and laptops have become our every day companions. We take them with us wherever we go, may it be the classroom or meetings, lately they have even made an appearance in courtrooms \cite{Farrell:TrialByTablet}. Especially during presentations, mobile device usage is still perceived as rude and can be a source of distraction \cite{Bohmer:SmartphoneUseRude, Bajko:ComparativePerceptionSmartphoneMeeting, Kuznekoff:ImpactPhoneStudentLearning} although other studies indicate that lecture-relevant phone use in classrooms can actually be beneficial \cite{Kuznekoff:MobilePhoneClassroomTwitter}.

Instead of banning modern technologies, incorporating mobile devices into presentation workflows has proven to foster collaboration and connection between attendees in meetings \cite{Bohmer:SmartphoneUseRude} and could possibly promote participation and help introverts overcome the hurdle of speaking out loud \cite{Bry:Backstage}. The growing computing power as well as the ubiquitousness of mobile phones, tablets and laptops make them suitable candidates for giving instant feedback to speakers as well as voting and sharing relevant multi-media content on-the-fly. Resulting presentations provide more flexibility, a better understanding of the listeners' opinion and the potential to close the gap between the presenter and the audience.

In the following, related work is presented to both establish a context for my thesis and set my approach apart from existing ones. In the end the goals of my project and thesis are defined and discussed.

\section{Goals}
The main aim of the project and thesis is to explore different ways of incorporating mobile devices into presentations in business-settings efficiently and productively. This includes polls created by the speaker (both beforehand and on-the-fly), as covered by other studies, as well as continuous, spontaneous feedback as described in \cite{Teevan:MobileFeedbackDuringPresentation}. Additionally other types of annotations should be supported, namely textual comments, images, links and youtube-videos, which will be rendered accordingly on new presentation slides. I believe this approach has the potential of transforming presentations into an collaborative effort in which all meeting-participants are empowered to shape the progress and outcome of presentations. From a technological point of view, like most existing approaches \cite{Bry:Backstage, Cheng:TreebasedOnlinePresentations, Esponda:ElectronicVotingOnTheFly, Inoue:RealTimeQuestionnaire, Teevan:MobileFeedbackDuringPresentation, Triglianos:InteractiveWebPresentationsImpress}, an web application will be developed to make use of modern web technologies' quick prototyping capabilities and the web's cross-platform and cross-device nature. As \emph{WebSockets} have successfully been deployed in the real-time features of other presentation tools \cite{Inoue:RealTimeQuestionnaire, Triglianos:InteractiveWebPresentationsImpress} (in \cite{Inoue:RealTimeQuestionnaire} a difference in response time between 10 and 600 simultaneous users of under 150ms and a package loss of approximately 0\% was reported), this technology will be used to communicate between speaker and audience. Like in \cite{Triglianos:InteractiveWebPresentationsImpress}, an existing web presentation library will be used to be able to concentrate on the collaborative features rather than building a cross-device presentation platform. Instead of \emph{impress.js}, \emph{reveal.js}\footnote{http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/} will be used for this purpose, as it already offers a few key features, namely focus on mobile devices, embedded videos, speaker-notes and a possibility to follow or control presentation from ones personal device.
