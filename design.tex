\chapter{Application Design}
\label{cha:design}

After defining the mechanisms which will be implemented, in a next step, the general application flow will be described, as well as offering insight into the user experience design of the parts of the application.

\section{Application Flow}
The flow and usage of the application is separated into two parts: the creation and authoring of the presentation and giving the presentation. As the technical details of how slide decks are composed are covered in chapter \ref{cha:implementation}, this chapter focuses on the user interface and interaction design of the software from the speaker's and the audience's point of view, during the presentation.

The typical setup of an unveil presentation is as follows. We assume a presenter called Amy, who has already prepared her presentation and a listener called Greg who wants to follow the presentation from his smartphone.
The slides are generally served from a server. This can either be a publicly accessible server or, if all participants are in the same network, locally from Amy's computer. We assume Amy is serving the slides from her laptop, which is connected to a projector.
At the beginning of the presentation, Greg and all other listeners have to navigate their personal devices' browsers to the set up address (usually a combination of IP address and port). To make this step easier, Amy has put a QR code pointing to the address on the first slide and sent out an e-mail with the link to all participants before the start of the presentation.

The software supports three different modes out of the box: listener, speaker and projector mode. Depending on the mode, a certain set of features is activated, allowing Amy to have a different interface and more controls than Greg. Modes are activated via query parameters in the url: Amy navigates her laptop's browser to the url of the presentation and adds the query parameter \texttt{mode=projector}. On her smartphone, which she wants to use for remote controlling the presentation, the mode is set to \texttt{speaker}. If no query parameter is given, the application defaults to the listener mode, so Greg simply types in the address or follows the link in the url or QR code. Unveil generally offers a two-dimensional slide space, consisting of master slides (left to right) and subslides (top to bottom). Devices in speaker mode (in this example Amy's smartphone) can remote-control the presentation and navigate through said slides. All other devices (the laptop's in projector mode and Greg's phone) are synchronised with the state of Amy's phone and automatically follow along in real-time.

\section{General Interface}
The general requirement for the interface of the application is to work in all three modes, on any device, from mobile phones to desktops and projectors. When in projector mode, only the content of the current slide, as well as listener reactions are shown (see figure \ref{fig:design-interface-projector}). In listener mode, the interface is a lot richer and additionally features buttons for sharing media, links and asking questions, as well as six different reactions (see figure \ref{fig:design-interface-listener}), which will be discussed in more detail in section \ref{}. It also offers small arrow buttons, to navigate between slides. The speaker interface is the most intricate: Besides showing the current slide, we believe it should also include a preview of the upcoming slides in $x$ (master slide) and $y$ (subslide) direction, as well as speaker notes. Additionally there are buttons to mute incoming requests (media, link and questions) and to create new polls (see figure \ref{fig:design-interface-presenter}).

\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{wireframes/projector-interface}\caption{Wireframe of slide in projector mode, as seen on a projector. No visual controls are shown, only the current slide and listener reactions are displayed. The presentation progresses through the presenter mode's remote controlling feature.}\label{fig:design-interface-projector}\end{figure}

\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=.831\textwidth]{wireframes/listener-interface}\caption{Wireframes of general interface in listener mode for mobile phones and desktops. Both offer buttons to share media, links and questions with the presenter, arrow buttons to navigate through the presentation and a possibility to react to the current slide. On mobile this feature is revealed with a tap on the \emph{reaction} button.}\label{fig:design-interface-listener}\end{figure}

\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{wireframes/speaker-interface}\caption{Wireframes of general interface in speaker mode for mobile phones and desktops. The interface consists of a preview of the current slide, the next main slide (\emph{right}) and the next subslide (\emph{down}), as well as showing presenter notes. It also offers buttons to toggle muting of incoming requests and creation of new polls.}\label{fig:design-interface-presenter}\end{figure}

\section{General Interaction Principles}
As far as the interaction design of the application is concerned, the main requirement technically is for all state changes to take immediate effect or in other words, for the software to work in real-time. This is true for interactions with the server as well as all internal state changes within the application. All transitions and animations last $200$ms, a value which is both usable on mobile phones and desktops and ``fast enough that it doesn't cause waiting, but slow enough that the transition can be understood'' \cite{GoogleMaterialDesignGuide}. An easing curve with low outgoing and high incoming velocity is used.

The general aim for the interaction design of the application to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible on any device and for both presenters and listeners. Especially the speaker's view has a lot of information to display and many ways to interact with the interface. From the speaker's point of view, the main reason for negative presentation experiences stems from technical difficulties and problems \cite{Wacker:PresenterExperience}. We therefore decided to design a presenter interface similar to the one known from PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides or reveal.js and employ familiar visual metaphors and interaction mechanisms such as modals (see figure \ref{}).



% how can we interact? swipe/arrow keys etc., explain modals, hover states etc.


% As described before, it is important for the presenter to be in full control of all mechanisms --> make it easy to add or remove them and to configure!

% Wacker: research has shown that technological problems are the main reason for negative presentation experiences for the speaker. ``Therefore, presentation software should take special care to avoid technological problems and assist the presenter if they should occur''

% We believe it is still important for the speaker to have an overview of the current slide as well as upcoming ones and be able to see notes on the presenter interface

% Emojis
% Find more studies about this! think: facebook, the conference Paulo went to etc. (maybe add photo of audience showing emoji faces!)
% It is therefore important to provide more detailed feedback. Following the evaluation in \cite{Teevan:MobileFeedbackDuringPresentation}, the mechanism proposed in this thesis offers three emotions (approval, laughter, boredom) and three request types (louder, speed up, slow down).

% Polls: Describe why freeze navigation while voting and only allow voting when started by presenter
