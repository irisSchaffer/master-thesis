% Application Flow, Modes, How does the application work in general?
% Design aspects, sketches, wireframes, thoughts and Ã¼berlegungen behind design details

% Wacker: research has shown that technological problems are the main reason for negative presentation experiences for the speaker. ``Therefore, presentation software should take special care to avoid technological problems and assist the presenter if they should occur''

% We believe it is still important for the speaker to have an overview of the current slide as well as upcoming ones and be able to see notes on the presenter interface

% General requirements: be viewable on every device, work in real-time!

% Emojis: Find more studies about this! think: facebook, the conference Paulo went to etc. (maybe add photo of audience showing emoji faces!)
