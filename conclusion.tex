In this thesis, we present \emph{unveil}: an extensible JavaScript presentation eco\-system with a multitude of interactive mechanisms, aiming to make presentations more engaging, memorable and collaborative. At its core it consists of four different libraries, connecting presenters, listeners and projectors through a WebSocket server, making it possible for both audience and speakers to alter $2$-dimensional slide-sets in real time.
Different types of presentations were analysed to find their weaknesses and establish ways of enhancing the presentation experience. The resulting mechanisms, amongst others, include browsing and following of slides on any device, instanteneous audience-reactions via emoji, real-time voting and voting-creation on-the-fly as well as a way of sharing multi-media content during the presentation, effectively allowing listeners to add main and sub-slides from their personal devices. This makes it possible for the audience to truely shape the path through a presentation using nothing but the mobile devices they carry on them and holds the potential of connecting members of the audience with each other and the speaker. Although making presentations more enjoyable for the audience, this approach poses new challenges and requires more flexibility from the speaker, which is why all realised mechanisms can easily be turned on and off. The application was generally designed for other developers to re-use, modify and extend and therefore offers ways of tailoring and configuring every last detail, from the routing logic over the emoji displayed to the mechanisms enabled for each user group (presenter, listener, projector).

Although long-term studies will be necessary to validate our approach and verify and quantify their success, initial observation and evaluation of the system showed promising results. The users understood the interface and were especially excited about the possibility of sharing their own content and thoughts with the presentation. This mechanism was particularly well-accepted during informal meetings, were the usage organically evolved into a brain-storming like activity, involving all participants. The initial evaluation of our prototype also showed room for improvement, amongst others, the persistence of the created presentation and the absence of native sharing features on the phone. In future iterations of the libraries, the stability and testability of the platform will be improved as well as offering a way of permanently altering the presentation.
Moreover, a graphical user interface for the creation of slides is desirable, effectively opening interactive presentations to non-developers. The trials also gave way to ideas for future projects, most notably the combination of these interactive mechanisms with existing presentation software, with canvas-based ones being of special interest.
